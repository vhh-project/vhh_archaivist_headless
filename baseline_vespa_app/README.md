In the following sections we will show some exemplary ways for feeding documents and sending queries to this application. For a more comprehensive introduction to all possibilities please visit the vespa documentation: 
- [Quick Start](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/vespa-quick-start.html)
- [All sections under 'Reads and Writes'](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/reads-and-writes.html)
### Default schema
The default schema, which can be customized to your needs, is comprised of following fields: 
- **id** - Allows full text IDs
- **body** - Stores the plain text representation of the document and is the only indexed field
- **language** (Optional) - Can be provided to be able to filter queries based on document source language
- **parent_doc** (Optional) - Name of the parent document, if feeding single document pages
- **page** (Optional) - Page number, if feeding single document pages
- **collection** (Optional) - Parameter for grouping multiple parent documents in collections

The full schema can be found at [baseline_vespa_app/src/main/application/schemas/baseline.sd](baseline_vespa_app/src/main/application/schemas/baseline.sd)

### Feeding (text only)
 As mentioned earlier there are several ways to feed documents to the vespa application. Here we will demonstrate one way to feed single documents via the [/document/v1 API](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/document-v1-api-guide.html):

 Send a POST request to 
 
 ```http://hostname:8080/document/v1/baseline/baseline/docid/<document_id>```

 with the desired *document_id* at the end of the path.
 
 The body should be in JSON format and could look like this:
 ```json
 {
     "fields": {
         "body": "Insert text content of your document here"
     }
 }
 ```
Feel free to also populate the other fields introduced above when feeding data. This example only represents the bare minimum a feed requires.

### Querying

#### Request
Querying can be done through vespa's own [Query API](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/query-api.html). The query API allows both GET requests with according query parameters or a POST request with a JSON body containing the necessary fields. Next we will show an example request (POST for better readability) and explain the details:

```
http://hostname:8080/search
```
The JSON body:
```json
{
    "searchChain": "multilangchain",
    "yql": "select * from sources * where default contains 'this is a demo query';",
    "hits": 5,
    "offset": 0,
    "presentation.format": "query-meta-json"
}
```
- searchChain - this is required to trigger our custom multilingual searcher component
- [yql](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/query-language.html) - vespa's own query language. Queries targeting the *body* or *default* field are multilingually expanded
- hits (optional; default: 10) - amount of relevant documents to return
- offset (optional; default: 0) - offset to start from returning documents
- presentation.format: The '**query-meta-json**' format is a custom-built extension of the default result format of vespa. It adds an additional '**query-metadata**' field to the result containing information about the internal query translation

Keep in mind, that vespa and our custom searcher run language detection on the query body. Unfortunately, short queries often can not be successfully recognized and therefore default to english. Languages not supported by the stemmer and/or the translation service also default to english.

#### Response
The response with the above query setup mostly follows the [default JSON result format](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/reference/default-result-format.html) with the addition of the '**query-metadata**' field in the 'root' object. 

The output for each relevant document, i.e. which fields are displayed and in which manner, can be configured via attributes in the schema fields. For example, the body field currently has the 'summary' attribute set to 'dynamic', which returns a relevant text snippet from the document body with matching words highlighted accordingly. To return the full document body, this attribute has to be removed.

#### Synonyms
As an additional step in the translation process, we look for synonyms of specific (currently English) phrases and multilingual aliases contained in [word2word_api/wikidata-aliases.txt](../word2word_api/wikidata-aliases.txt). Any found synonyms also are returned in the response and consequently used for extending the initial query. 

File format for synonyms: main-phrase \<tab> synonym 1 \<tab> synonym 2 \<tab> synonym 3 \<tab> ...

In order to disable synonym detection or change the file path, take a look at [word2word_api/config.ini](../word2word_api/config.ini).

To disable synonym detection for single queries, see the **synonyms** parameter for [GET /search](../vespa-api/README.md#get-search).
